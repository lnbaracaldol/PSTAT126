1. This question uses the *cereal* data set available in the Homework Assignment 2 on Canvas. The following command can be used to read the data into R. Make sure the "cereal.txt" file is in the same folder as your R/Rmd file.


```{r cereal}
Cereal <- read.table("cereal.txt",header=T)
str(Cereal)
```

```{r cereal2, include=F}
model <- lm(rating~protein+fat+fiber+carbo+sugars+potass+vitamins+cups, data= Cereal)
summary(model)
```
The data set *cereal* contains measurements for a set of $77$ cereal brands. For this assignment only consider the following variables:

- Rating: Quality rating
- Protein: Amount of protein. 
- Fat: Amount of fat.
- Fiber: Amount of fiber.
- Carbo: Amount of carbohydrates.
- Sugars: Amount of sugar.
- Potass: Amount of potassium. 
- Vitamins: Amount of vitamins.
- Cups: Portion size in cups.

Our goal is to study how *rating* is related to all other 8 variables.\
\
(a) (4pts) Explore the data and perform a descriptive analysis of each variable, include any plot/statistics that you find relevant (histograms, scatter diagrams, correlation coefficients). Did you find any outlier? If yes, is it reasonable to remove this observation? why?\
\
(b) (3pts) Use the lm function in R to fit the MLR model with *rating* as the response and the other $8$ variables as predictors. Display the summary output.\
\
(c)(3pts) Which predictor variables are statistically significant under the significance threshold value of 0.01?\
\
(d)(2pts) What proportion of the total variation in the response is explained by the predictors?\
\
(e)(3pts) What is the null hypothesis of the global F-test? What is the p-value for the global F-test? Do the 7 predictor variables explain a significant proportion of the variation in the response?\
\
(f)(2pts) Consider testing the null hypothesis $H_0: \beta_{carbo} = 0$, where $\beta_{carbo}$ is the coefficient corresponding to *carbohydrates* in the MLR model. Use the t value available in the summary output to compute the p-value associated with this test, and verify that the p-value you get is identical to the p-value provided in the summary output.\
\
(g)(4pts)Suppose we are interested in knowing if either *vitamins* or *potass* had any relation to the response *rating*. What would be the corresponding null hypothesis of this statistical test? Construct a F-test, report the corresponding p-value, and your conclusion.\
\
(h)(3pts) Use the summary output to construct a 99% confidence interval for $\beta_{protein}$. What is the interpretation of this confidence interval?\
\
(i)(3pts) What is the predicted *rating* for a cereal brand with the following information:\

- Protein=3 
- Fat=5
- Fiber=2
- Carbo=13
- Sugars=6
- Potass=60 
- Vitamins=25
- Cups=0.8

(j). (3pts) What is the 95\% prediction interval for the observation in part (i)? What is the interpretation of this prediction interval?\

Q2.(20pts) Consider the MLR model with $p$ predictors:
$$\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol \beta+\boldsymbol\epsilon, \qquad \boldsymbol \epsilon \sim N_n(\boldsymbol 0,\sigma^2\boldsymbol I_n)$$
If we define $\hat\sigma^2=\frac{SSR}{n-p^*}$, with $p^*=p+1$. Use theoretical results from the lectures to show that $\hat\sigma^2$ is an unbiased estimator of $\sigma^2$. Find $V(\hat\sigma^2)$.
