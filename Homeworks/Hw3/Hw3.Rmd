1. This question uses the *cereal* data set.
\
The data set *cereal* contains measurements for a set of $77$ cereal brands. For this assignment only consider the following variables:

- Rating: Quality rating
- Protein: Amount of protein. 
- Fat: Amount of fat.
- Fiber: Amount of fiber.
- Carbo: Amount of carbohydrates.
- Sugars: Amount of sugar.
- Potass: Amount of potassium. 
- Vitamins: Amount of vitamins.
- Cups: Portion size in cups.

Our goal is to study how *rating* is related to all other 8 variables.\

(a) **(2 pts)** Run a multiple linear regression model after removing observations 5,21 and 58. Calculate the fitted response values and the residuals from the linear model mentioned above. Use *head* function to show the first 5 entries of the fitted response values and the first 5 entries of the residuals.\

(b) **(2 pts)** Use a graphical diagnostic approach to check if the random errors have constant variance. Briefly explain what diagnostics method you used and what is your conclusion.\

(c) **(2 pts)** Use a graphical method to check if the random errors follow a normal distribution. What do you conclude?\

(d) **(3 pts)** Run a *Shapiro-Wilk* test to check if the random errors follow a normal distribution. What is the null hypothesis in this test? What is the p-value associated with the test? What is your conclusion?\

(e) **(3 pts)** Plot successive pairs of residuals. Do you find serial correlation among observations?\

(f) **(3 pts)** Run a *Durvin-Watson* test to check if the random errors are uncorrelated. What is the null hypothesis in this test? What is the p-value associated with the test? What is your conclusion?\

(g) **(2 pts)** Compute the hat matrix $\boldsymbol H$ in this data set (you donâ€™t need to show the entire matrix). Verify numerically that $\sum_{i=1}^nH_{ii}=p^*=p+1$.\

(h) **(2 pts)** Check graphically if there is any high-leverage point. What is the criterion you used?\

(i) **(2 pts)** Compute the standardized residuals. Without drawing a plot, is there any outlier? What is the criterion you used?\

(j) **(2 pts)** Calculate the Cook's distance. How many observations in this data set have a Cook's distance that is greater than $4/n$?\

(k) **(2 pts)** Check whether the response needs a Box-Cox transformation. If a Box-Cox transformation is necessary, what would be the form of the transformation?\
