1. This question uses the Auto dataset available in the ISLR package. The dataset under the name *Auto* is automatically available once the ISLR package is loaded.

```{r dat, include=TRUE}
library(ISLR)
data(Auto)
```
```{r model, include=FALSE}
Autod<- Auto
Autod$cylinders<- as.factor(Autod$cylinders)
Autod$year<- as.factor(Autod$year)
Autod$origin<- as.factor(Autod$origin)
lmod<- lm(mpg~. - name, Autod)
```
The dataset *Auto* contains the following information for $392$ vehicles:

- mpg: miles per gallon
- cylinders: number of cylinders (between 4 and 8)
- displacement: engine displacement (cu.inches)
- horsepower: engine horsepower
- weight: vehicle weight (lbs)
- acceleration: time to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (seconds)
- year: model year 
- origin: origin of the vehicle (numerically coded as 1: American, 2: European, 3: Japanese)
- name: vehicle name

Our goal is to analyze several linear models where *mpg* is the response variable.\

(a) **(2 pts)** In this data set, which predictors are qualitative, and which predictors are quantitative?
(b) **(2 pts)** Fit a MLR model to the data, in order to predict mpg using all of the other predictors except for name. For each predictor in the fitted MLR model, comment on whether you can reject the null hypothesis
that there is no linear association between that predictor and mpg, conditional on the other predictors in the model.
(c) **(2 pts)** What mpg do you predict for a Japanese car with three cylinders, displacement 100, horsepower of 85, weight of 3000, acceleration of 20, built in the year 1980?
(d) **(2 pts)** On average, holding all other predictor variables fixed, what is the difference between the mpg of a Japanese car and the mpg of an European car?
(e) **(2 pts)** Fit a model to predict *mpg* using origin and horsepower, as well as an interaction between origin and horsepower. Present the summary output of the fitted model, and write out the fitted linear model.
(f) **(2 pts)** If we are fitting a polynomial regression with mpg as the response variable and weight as the predictor, what should be a proper degree of that polynomial?
(g) **(4 pts)** Perform a backward selection, starting with the full model which includes all predictors (except for name). What is the best model based on the AIC criterion? What are the predictor variables in
that best model?
